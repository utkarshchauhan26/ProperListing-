## 💡 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Technical Decisions**

1. **Authentication Strategy**
   - **Recommendation:** Stick with JWT tokens (backend is already implemented)
   - Remove NextAuth.js complexity for now
   - Can add OAuth later as enhancement

2. **Image Storage**
   - **Recommendation:** Implement Cloudinary integration
   - Free tier supports up to 25 credits/month
   - Easy integration with existing multer setup

3. **Database**
   - **Recommendation:** Run `prisma migrate dev` to sync schema
   - Add database seeding script for development data

### **Architecture Improvements**

1. **API Response Standardization**
   ```typescript
   interface ApiResponse<T> {
     success: boolean;
     data?: T;
     error?: string;
     pagination?: PaginationInfo;
   }
   ```

2. **Error Handling Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Implement consistent error responses
   // Add global error boundary in React
   // Use proper HTTP status codes
   ```

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   ```typescript
   // Add React Query for caching
   // Implement lazy loading
   // Optimize database queries
   ```
